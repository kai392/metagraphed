// Baseline-diff, not zero-tolerance: this app has pre-existing, already-tracked
// overflow bugs (#3930, #3931, #3985, etc.) that are separately-scored
// contributor work, not something this check should force-fix or block on.
// The baseline is a snapshot of KNOWN violations at the time it was last
// regenerated; this test fails only on a NEW element escaping the viewport
// that isn't already in that snapshot -- converting "a human might notice a
// new regression by luck" into "CI always catches it," without also making
// every apps/ui PR red until the existing backlog is cleared.
//
// Regenerate after intentionally fixing (shrinks it) or after confirming a
// new entry is an accepted layout choice, not a bug (grows it) --
// `npm run test:e2e:update-baseline --workspace=apps/ui`. Don't hand-edit;
// let the script keep it consistent with the real detector output.
//
// Deterministic by design: every route replays a HAR fixture
// (tests/e2e/har/*.har, recorded via `npm run test:e2e:record-har`) instead
// of hitting live production data. Before this, the set of DOM elements a
// route rendered (and therefore what could overflow) depended on live chain
// state -- a subnet's incident history changing shape could newly trip this
// check for a PR that never touched the affected page (confirmed: the
// /status page's incidents-feed overflow, introduced by an unrelated PR,
// sat undetected for ~14h until live incident data happened to surface it).
// Re-record the HAR (in addition to the baseline, if the DOM also changed)
// whenever a route's real API surface changes -- a stale HAR aborts/falls
// back predictably rather than silently drifting.
